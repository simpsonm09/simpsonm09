<h3>About Me:</h3>

<p>I have always been fascinated with technology. As a child, I was an avid video gamer and enjoyed tinkering and challenging game systems. As I got older, I became more interested in computers and started building my own PCs. I enjoy creating tools to help improve others' outcomes with technology. In my previous position as a Technical Solutions Engineer at Epic, I developed software enhancements, bug-fixes, and other internal software troubleshooting tools in the Intersystems Caché database language to support our customers and coworkers. I'm passionate about creating and enhancing software to help users embrace technology and improve their lives. From this, I am looking for a position as a Software Developer where I can continue to enrich others and challenge myself, as well as bringing an analytical and personable eye to the products I work on.</p>

<p>In addition to my programming background, I received my bachelors in Chemistry from Case Western Reserve University. While I did enjoy the analytical side of that field, at the time I decided I was not interested in doing lab work and instead spent the last 7 years working in Healthcare IT primarily as Technical Support. In this role, I discovered I had a strength for communication by effectively translating end user needs to our developers as well as collaborating with multiple disciplines across unique hospital organizations. On top of that, I worked on side projects to improve my clients' and coworkers' experience through independent development and education. As I continued to excel in my role and work more and more on software side projects, I found a burning desire to become focused on software development as a creator/collaborator, and decided to make the jump to Tech Elevator to learn new skills such as Java, SQL, JavaScript, and Responsive Web Design to support this career transition.</p>
